## About

This repository tracks my first year of coding in 2025. I began with **Python** and **Java**, and as my journey evolves, I've expanded my studies to include **C, C++ and Assembly**. My goal is to build a strong foundation across multiple programming paradigms—from high-level application development to low-level system programming.

Explore the projects and code samples here to see my progress, challenges, and learnings over the course of the year.

## Technologies

My current focus includes:

- **Python**: Crafting scripts, automation, and exploring data-driven applications.
- **Java**: Developing object-oriented solutions and mastering design patterns.
- **JavaScript**: Creating dynamic and interactive web interfaces.
- **HTML & CSS**: Designing and styling modern web pages.
- **SCSS**: Leveraging advanced CSS features for scalable styling.
- **C**: Diving into system-level programming and fundamental computing concepts.
- **C++**: Enhancing performance-critical applications and exploring advanced programming techniques.
- **Assembly**: Gaining insights into computer architecture and low-level operations.
